# Taskvo v2 🚀

Taskvo v2 is a modern, API-first task management platform built with scalability and clean architecture in mind.

This repository represents **version 2** of Taskvo — a complete rebuild using **Django REST Framework**.  
The previous version (v1) was built with vanilla Django and had messy architecture; v2 focuses on clean APIs, extensibility, and future AI integration.
